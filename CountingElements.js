/*
  Give an integer array [arr], count element x such that x+1 is also in [arr]
  If there's duplicates in [arr], count them seperately

  Example 1: 
  input: [1,2,3]
  output: 2
  Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in the input.
  Constraints: 
    * 1 <= arr.length <=1000
    * 0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
